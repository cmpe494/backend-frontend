title Remote Control Operations (UC-SC4)

actor "System Administrator" as Admin
participant "Admin Dashboard UI" as UI
participant "Command Management Service" as CMS
participant "Device Communication Gateway" as DCG
participant "Target Device" as Device

Admin -> UI: 1. Admin selects device "Kiosk-01"
activate UI
Admin -> UI: 2. Admin sends "REBOOT" command

UI -> CMS: 3. Request Remote Command (Kiosk-01, REBOOT)
deactivate UI
activate CMS

CMS -> DCG: 4. Transmit Command Securely (Kiosk-01, REBOOT)
activate DCG

alt Basic Flow: Device executes successfully (Example: Kiosk-01 REBOOT)
    DCG -> Device: 5. Encrypted Command (REBOOT)
    activate Device
    Device -> Device: 6. Execute REBOOT command
    Device --> DCG: 7. Command Result ("Reboot Initiated")
    deactivate Device
else Error Flow: Device fails to execute command (Scenario: Kiosk-Legacy UPDATE_SOFTWARE)
    note over Admin, Device: This path illustrates the "Device fails to execute command" scenario where Admin sends "UPDATE_SOFTWARE" to "Kiosk-Legacy".
    DCG -> Device: 5a. Encrypted Command (UPDATE_SOFTWARE)
    activate Device
    Device -> Device: 6a. Encounters internal error during UPDATE_SOFTWARE
    Device --> DCG: 7a. Error Response ("Command Execution Failed: Error Code 500")
    deactivate Device
end

DCG --> CMS: 8. Secure Response (result/error)
deactivate DCG

CMS --> UI: 9. Command Execution Status (result/error detail)
deactivate CMS
activate UI

UI --> Admin: 10. Display Status to Admin (result/error detail)
